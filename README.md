# Unreal Bunny

This is an Unreal Engine project that uses a custom material and blueprint to display the Stanford Bunny as a point cloud, using the technique created by  [xnihil0zer0](https://forums.unrealengine.com/member.php?27525-xnihil0zer0) and described in [this Unreal forum thread](https://forums.unrealengine.com/showthread.php?91501).

This method uses a bitmap image derived from the point cloud as a lookup table to position the individual particles.

Many thanks to xnihil0zer0 for creating this technique, and for the kind and patient assistance in getting my version of it working.
