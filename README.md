# Unreal Bunny

This is an attempt to display the Stanford Bunny point cloud in Unreal Engine, as described in [this Unreal forum post](https://forums.unrealengine.com/showthread.php?91501-How-to-place-single-GPU-particles-at-specified-locations&p=428488&viewfull=1\#post428488).

I thought I followed all the steps listed, but no points are displayed.

Hopefully there is some elementary Unreal Engine thing I missed. If anyone has any idea what is wrong, pointers are much appreciated!
